# Arithmetic
Given a goal and a series of numbers, the program determines whether or not the goal number can be calculated using a combination of addition and multiplication.

A recursive approach ensures the optimal solution is found (as large numbers can be calculated).

Application finds solutions in the BEDMAS order or operations as well as left-to right.
